Building with CMake:
'cmake .'

Variables to pass for CMake:

Path to headers		-DCMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH=<path to headers>
Path to libraries	-DCMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH=<path to libraries>
Install prefix		-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<prefix>


Separate multiple folders with colons, for example:
'path1:path2:path3'

After running CMake run 'make' to build the binaries and 'make package' to build RPMs.

To build without CMake, use the provided makefile and provide
custom include and library directories as:

'make <libpath> <incpath>'

where <libpath> and <incpath> are:

'LIBPATH=<path to first library folder> [-L<path to additional library folder>...]'
'INCPATH=<path to first include folder> [-L<path to additional include folder>...]'
